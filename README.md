# Educational-Infrastructure-Interactive-Dashboard

This repository showcases an interactive dashboard that visualizes educational infrastructure data from Russian regions using PowerBI. In this project 
I have used secondary data collected by the HSE Institute of Education from official state statistical monitorings in 2016-2017. This data covers 
school personnel, equipment, informational and methodological support, inclusive environments infrastructure. 

In Russia, such data is typically 
presented in a statistical compendium such as the [Index of Educational Infrastructure in Russian Regions 2018-2019](https://ioe.hse.ru/data/2019/04/15/1178142809/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B8%CC%86%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%8B%202018-2019_2019-04-12.pdf) (available in Russian).
The dashboard offers a more convenient and compact way for readers to explore and use this data. I have added a selector to make a choice of topics and 
indicators on a single page together with different types of visualization, including geographic map. 

The files for the dashboard are available in pbix format in both Russian and English languages.
Moreover, the Russian-language dashboard can be opened in a web browser without the need to install PowerBI software, using a [link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTgxNTA2MjUtYjFmMC00YzBjLTkyMWMtODk1N2U4NjZjMDFlIiwidCI6ImZmN2QwMmE4LTE0MWYtNGMzOC1iODExLThiZWM0ZGIyYjBmMiIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSectionda0682a18f1e27fdab3f).
